# Determining the Optimal Regression Model for Predicting Product Quality of KC Roasters Coffee Beans
## Business Context
Coffee roasting is the process of turning green coffee beans into brown ones. Brown coffee beans can be made in a variety of methods, which also influences the flavor of the end product. A roasting instrument is basically a convection oven. It is a mechanism of inflicting heat energy into the raw product which makes the product consumable. And the price of coffee is heavily influenced by the quality of the beans after roasting. As a result, the cost can be determined depending on the quality of the beans after roasting.

The rising automation in the manufacturing business necessitates the automation of quality inspection of output products with minimal human intervention. Quality inspectors in businesses examine product quality after it is manufactured to ensure that it meets industry standards.

Each product's quality inspection is a time-consuming manual process, and a low-quality product wastes upstream factory capacity, consumables, labor, and money. With the emerging AI trend, companies are looking to leverage machine learning-based technologies to automate material quality inspection during the manufacturing process to reduce human intervention while achieving human-level or better accuracy.

## Objective
A roasting corporation named "KC Roasters" has engaged me to predict the quality of a roasting instrument's outputs, which will be used to determine the price of coffee beans. The quality value ranges from 0 to 100 with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best. The higher the quality of the beans, the higher the price.

The coffee roasting instrument used by Roasters is divided into five equal-sized compartments, each with three temperature sensors. 3 sensors have been installed at 3 different locations to be able to capture temperature at different locations inside the chamber. Additionally, the height of raw material (volume entering the chamber) and relative humidity of roasted material is provided.

The data shared consists of 17 predictor variables and a continuous target variable, and the aim is to build a Regression model which can accurately predict the quality of the product. After finding out the quality, the company can decide the cost of beans effectively.
